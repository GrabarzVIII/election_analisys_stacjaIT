# 🗳️ Election Analysis – Stacja IT Workshop

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an election data analysis project developed during the **"Python – Data Analysis and Statistical Modeling Based on Election Results"** workshop, organized by **Stacja IT** (Sages Sp. z o.o.) and led by **Wiktor Piela**.

The project focuses on:
- Loading, cleaning, and exploring election data,
- Creating statistical and predictive models,
- Visualizing trends and geographic patterns,
- Working with spatial data to analyze regional differences.

## 🧑‍🎓 Certification

This project was completed by **Kacper Grabarczyk** during a certified workshop on **June 8, 2025**.

During the workshop, the participant:
- Learned to work with `pandas` and `numpy` for data analysis,
- Built and managed virtual environments for Python workflows,
- Visualized data using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `folium`,
- Applied linear models with `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`,
- Gained foundational skills for further development in machine learning,
- Worked with geospatial data using `geopandas`, `shapely`, and `pyproj`.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries

- **Data Processing:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `openpyxl`, `joblib`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`, `branca`
